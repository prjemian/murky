Obsolete.

The ``murky_create.sh`` bash shell script is a hybrid micromamba/conda
environment creator. It creates an explicit conda environment file (specific
package versions) for conda using micromamba.  Since this script was first
created, the conda tool has become much faster, through use of the ``libmamba``
solver.
